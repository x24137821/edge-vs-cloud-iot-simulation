# 🌐 **Fog Computing Simulation**

## 🚀 **Project Overview**
This project simulates a **Fog Computing** environment using **CloudSim**, a widely used cloud and fog computing simulation tool. It models the interaction between IoT devices, fog nodes, and cloud resources. The goal is to optimize data processing by reducing latency, minimizing resource usage, and offloading tasks from edge devices to the cloud.

## 📁 **Project Structure**
- **CloudSim**: Core simulation tool to model cloud and fog environments.
- **VMs & Cloudlets**: Configuration of Virtual Machines (VMs) to execute tasks, and cloudlets representing computational workloads.
- **Resource Allocation**: Memory, processing power, and bandwidth allocated to fog nodes and cloud resources for efficient operations.

## 🛠️ **Requirements**
- **Java 8** or above.
- **CloudSim (version 3.0)**.

## 📝 **Setup Instructions**
To get started with the simulation, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_link>

2. **Compile and run the simulation using your preferred IDE or command line:**
   ```bash
    FogComputingSimulation.java
